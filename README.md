PlGit
=====

I've been looking for an easy way to look at repositories and diffs in a web 
interface.  I haven't enjoyed any thus far, and thus, I start this repo with
the hope of building a decent object model in perl that I can enjoy against
a repo, with the goal of being a read only view into a bunch of stuff in git.

People might point me to a bunch, but I want a minimal one, that runs with
dancer or something similar and just thought to the heck with it, one might
already exist, but I'm not doing enough on my github account.  Let's see how
it turns out and if it has the possibility of becoming useful.

First test!
